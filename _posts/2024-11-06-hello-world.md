This summer, as a part of the 2024 Alberta Innovates HYRS (High School Youth Researcher Summer) Program, I was placed in the Jin Lab, getting to immerse myself into the intricate world of research at CCIT for two months. 

For my experience, I delved into the inner workings on bacterial genomes and their adaptive mechanisms. 

Preprogrammed phase variation can occur through DNA inversions. Recombinase enzymes bind to regions that intervene the inverton, known as inverted repeats. The intervening region (the inverton) could be regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. 

I investigated how regions in DNA, known as invertons, invert themselves in response to external stimuli and stress. 

Specefically in our research, I took genome data from —— of bacteria grown in an environment in and without the presence of streptomycin. With this data,
