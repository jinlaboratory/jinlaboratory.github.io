# Welcome to the Jin Lab!
We are part of the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/biomedical/home) at the [University of Calgary](https://ucalgary.ca/).

The Jin lab studies the role of spatial structure in microbial communities such as the gut microbiome. We use synthetic biology to engineer and manipulate microbial communities with defined spatial structure, and use computational biology to measure / model how spatial structure affects community ecology, evolution, and function.
