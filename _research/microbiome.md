We are applying engineering approaches to generate model microbial communities, with tunable control over community composition and structure. For instance, we have developed *in vitro* culture platforms with synthetic mucosal surfaces, to profile how surface adhesion modulates function in a defined consortia of human gut microbes. In ongoing work, we are extending these platforms to explore the interplay between community composition, surface adhesion, and a variety of environmental stressors such as antimicrobial exposure or pathogenic invasion. This work will enable precise, quantitative characterization of how host-associated microbial communities critical to human health -- such as the human gut microbiome -- are affected by changes to their environments.
