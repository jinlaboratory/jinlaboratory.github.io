We are interested in using genetic engineering to rationally modulate structure in microbial communities, and learn how these changes ultimately affect community function. For instance, we have developed synthetic biology toolkits that allow for precise patterning of heterogenous biofilm communities, and used these toolkits in conjunction with biophysical modeling to characterize how patterning affects community functions, such as resistance to antimicrobial stress. In ongoing work, we are generalizing these approaches beyond simple communities of laboratory bacterial strains, and into more complex contexts such as the human gut microbiome. These efforts will pave the way toward rational manipulation of microbial communities for desired characteristics, such as the development of next-generation probiotics for modulating gut dysbiosis.
