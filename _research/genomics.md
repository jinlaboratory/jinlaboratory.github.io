We are developing computational tools to track ecology and evolution in defined microbial communities. These workflows analyze next generation sequencing datasets produced by shotgun metagenomic analysis of microbial communities, to reveal how these communities adapt at an eco-evolutionary level with resolution at the level of individual microbial strains and genes. In ongoing work, we are developing tools to track *de novo* mutations, genomic inversions, and instances of horizontal gene transfer across bacteria. We envision that such tools will be broadly applicable for a wide range of complex microbial communities, and will allow us to accurately identify critical eco-evolutionary events with consequences for human and environmental health, such as the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.
